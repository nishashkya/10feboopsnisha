    "2. In the ‘w’ mode, the file opens in write mode. It removes existing content, if present, in the file. If the specified file doesn’t exist, it creates one with the specified name. For Example, To open our file myfile.txt in ‘w’ mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the ‘a’ mode, the file opens in append mode. It adds content to an existing file (or append at the end of the file). If the specified file doesn’t exist, it creates one with the specified name. It does not remove the existing content from the file. For Example, To open our file myfile.txt in ‘a’ mode:\n",
